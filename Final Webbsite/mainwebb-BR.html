             <h2> Fortnite is an online video game first released in 2017 and developed by Epic Games. It is available as separate software packages having different game modes that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine. The game modes include Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build, and Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing. Both game modes were released in 2017 as early access titles; Save the World is available only for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, while Battle Royale has been released for those platforms in addition for Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android devices.

While both games have been successful for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale became a resounding success, drawing in more than 125 million players in less than a year, and earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and since has been a cultural phenomenon. </h2>

             <h2> PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games using the film Battle Royale for inspiration, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.

The game was first released for Microsoft Windows via Steam's early access beta program in March 2017, with a full release on December 20, 2017. That same month, the game was released by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One via its Xbox Game Preview program, and officially released in September 2018. The same year, two different mobile versions based on the game were released for Android and iOS. The game is one of the best-selling of all time, with over fifty million sold across all platforms by June 2018. In addition, the Windows version holds a peak concurrent player count of over three million on Steam, which is an all-time high on the platform. </h2>

             <h2> Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 (stylized as Call of Duty: Black Ops IIII) is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. It was released worldwide on October 12, 2018, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is a sequel to the 2015 game Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the fifth entry in the Black Ops sub-series, and the 15th installment in the Call of Duty series overall.

Black Ops 4 is the first Call of Duty title without a traditional single-player campaign mode. Instead, it features the Solo Missions mode, which focuses on the backstories of the game's multiplayer characters, known as "Specialists". The missions take place between Black Ops II and III chronologically. Some of the Specialists also carried over from Black Ops III. The multiplayer mode is the first in the series to not feature automatic health regeneration and introduces both predictive recoil and a new ballistics system. The game includes three Zombies maps on release day, four if a special edition of the game, or the Black Ops Pass, is purchased. The locations of the maps include the RMS Titanic, an arena in Ancient Rome, and Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. The game also introduces a battle royale mode called Blackout, which features up to 100 players in each match. Many characters from this and other Black Ops titles can be used as the player's character model in this mode. </h2>

          <h2> Planetside Arena is a game in development by Daybreak games and yet another game in the Battleroyal franchise. Daybreak games has previously worked on their game Planetside 2 which is a massive multiplayer online first person shooter with more than 1000 players batteling on the same server with up to three factions. Planetside arena is supposed to be a spinoff of Planetside 2 and the graphics and gunmechanics seems to be up to par with planetside 2. Beta test is still about a month away so there is no telling what this game is really like untill we get the chance to play it. It it revealed that the game will have up to two gamemodes at launch. One is the standard Battleroyale mode with solo and 3player squad modes available. The second is a 250 vs 250 player deathmatch which is an interresting idea and if it is good might revolutionise gaming.

             Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. Set in the same universe as Titanfall, the game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on February 4, 2019. Apex Legends differentiates itself from other battle royale games by borrowing concepts of the hero shooter, with each player-character Legend having unique skills and abilities, and principally requiring players to work in squads of three, with the ability to respawn downed squadmates.

While Respawn had been working on efforts towards a second sequel in the Titanfall series, the success of Fortnite Battle Royale led them to rework Titanfall elements into a battle royale genre, while keeping their own flavor in that genre. Respawn asked Electronic Arts to avoid any preliminary marketing for the game, releasing it on the same day it was announced, to avoid having players develop preconceived notions about the title. One week after its release, Apex Legends had over 25 million downloads and over 2 million concurrent players, and is considered to be a strong challenger to Fortnite' current dominance in the video game industry.
